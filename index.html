      <p>Hey, What's up? I am Ari Rosenthal, a native new yorker with a fine arts degree, working in IT, trying to become a web developer. I was raised in Huntington, NY (Looong IIIsland) until I was 16 when my immigrant (Israeli) mother decided to move us to Astoria. I currently work for a private federal contractor for the Department of Defense and the Department of Veteran Affairs as a database administrator. I spend long monotonous hours decrypting, formatting, and re-encrypting highly classified, sensitive data, namely active military and veteran's federal treatment medical records to be entered and used so that our company can perform and process pre and post discharge general medical and mental health evaluations for compensation and pension. Sounds fulfilling but boring, right? It is. I am an avid photographer with several awards under my belt. I once shot a "murder scene" that I thought would cause some heads to turn and maybe a disqualifier, however I won the top 3 awards at that show. Sometimes being a little weird pays off. Photography comes in a close second to my biggest joy in life, which is my extreme love for dogs. I once got into a verbal, ALMOST physical confrontation with a guy I saw dragging his dog on a leash down Ditmars blvd., don't do dat. I don't currently have a dog of my own at the moment because I really don't have the time to give a dog the attention it deserves. But I am best friends with a professional dog walker so I get my fix. Oy, look at the time, I gotta go.
